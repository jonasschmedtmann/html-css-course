    <h2>The Basic Language of the Web: HTML</h2>
    <p>
      All modern websites and web applications are built using three
      <em>fundamental</em>
      technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the
      web. In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all
      about, and why you too should learn it.

    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    <p>
      HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext
      <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup language
      that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage
      (not a programming language). HTML consists of elements that describe
      different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video,
      etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
