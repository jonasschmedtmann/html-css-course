      <h2>The Basic Language of the Web: HTML</h2>
      <p>
        All modern websites and web applications are built using three
        fundamental technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the
        languages of the web.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about,
        and why you too should learn it.
      </p>
      <h3>What is HTML</h3>
      <p>
        HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's a markup language that
        web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage
        (not a programming language).
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
        paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand
        HTML and render HTML code as websites.
      </p>
      <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The opening tag</li>
        <li>The closing tag</li>
        <li>The actual element</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
