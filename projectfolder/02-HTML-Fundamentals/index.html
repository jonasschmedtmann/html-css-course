		<h2>The Basic Langauge of The Web: HTML</h2>
		<p>Posted by <strong>Laura Jones </strong> on Monday, June 21st 2027</p>
		<p>
			All modern websites and web applications are built using three <em>fundamental</em> technologies: HTML, CSS and
			JavaScript. These are the languages of the web.
		</p>
		<p>In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.</p>
		<h3>What is HTML?</h3>
		<p>
			<strong>HTML </strong> stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup
			<strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of
			a webpage (not a programming language).
		</p>
		<p>
			HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video,
			etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
		</p>
		<p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The opening tag</li>
			<li>The closing tag</li>
			<li>The actual element</li>
			<li>You can learn more at the MDN Web Docs.</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Why should you learn HTML</h3>

		<p>There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the web. Here are 5 of them:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
			<li>To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like Worpress or Wix</li>
			<li>To build web applications</li>
			<li>To impress friends To have fun 😃</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!</p>
